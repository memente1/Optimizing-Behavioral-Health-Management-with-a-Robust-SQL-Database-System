Raise and Grow (RG) is dedicated to supporting adults with developmental disabilities and behavioral challenges by providing high-quality residential care and tailored programs. However, managing client data, staff schedules, program performance, and compliance reporting has become ever more complex with existing systems. This project aims to design and implement a centralized, secure, and scalable database solution. By restructuring data processes and enhancing operational efficiency, this database will empower RG;s management processes to deliver better care, track progress in real-time, and meet compliance requirements with ease.
